Right now, you will need to supply your own assets.
`process.rb` can be used to take the masked sprites and turn them into .pngs.

For tsukihime, you will want to place the assets at:

| Type  | Location                      |
| ----- | ----------------------------- |
| bg    | static/images/tsukihime/bg    |
| tachi | static/images/tsukihime/tachi |
